/**
 * Components as Building blocks in React
 * - everything in react is either a component or inside a component
 *
 * Components: react applications are entirely made ot of components
 *          - Bulding blocks of user interfaces in React
 *          - piece of UI that has its own data, logic, and appearance (how it works and looks)
 *          - we build complex UIs by building multiple components and combining them
 *          - Nesting and combining components is a key way of using components in react
 * Eg: question components, video component, (refine questions(parent component) --> filters (child component))
 */

/**
 * What is JSX
 * JSX: is a declarative syntax to describe what components look like and how they work
 *    - components must return a block of JSX
 *    - Extension of JavaScript that allows us to embed JavaScript CSS and React components into HTML
 *    - Each JSX element is converted to a React.createElement function call
 *    - we could actually use React without JSX
 *
 * JSX is DECLARATIVE: - Describe what UI should look like using JSX, based on current data
 *              - React is an abstraction away from DOM: we never touch the DOM
 *              - Instead, we think of the UI as a reflection of the current data
 *              (basically we tell React what we want on the screen, but not how)
 *
 * IMPERATIVE: manual DOM element selections and DOM traversing
 *          - Step-by-step DOM mutations until we reach the desired UI
 *            (vanilla react, basically tell react how to do things step by step)
